# Example for running ViT model

This example show case of ViT model. Model is from `transformers`, but cannot be traced by `transformers.utils.fx`. We fit it in our Merak and can run it with 3D parallelism.

## Running ViT model with ImageNet for classification

---

Run it according to following bash:

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4  run_vit.py \
         --per_device_train_batch_size 4 --gradient_accumulation_steps 4  \
         --cache-dir ./vit \
         --data-files /path/to/imagenet \
         --seq_length 1024 --output_dir ./output --remove_unused_columns False \
         --input_name "pixel_values"
```

Code is based on [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch/image-classification) repository.
