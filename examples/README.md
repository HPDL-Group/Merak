## Merak examples

These examples show that which model can be run with 3D parallelism in Merak. It shows that five popular models of pytorch, including GPT2, ViT, BERT, T5, Swin-transformer, running with 3D parallelism in Merak. These models show three cases of training model:

1. Model can be traced by `transformers.utils.fx` , like GPT2, T5 and BERT.
2. Model is from `transformers`, but cannot be traced by `transformers.utils.fx`, like ViT.
3. Model is not from `transformers`, but can be traced by `torch.fx`, like Swin-tranfromer.

User could make sense of Merak's mechanism by these examples, and apply it to another models. Currently, the running bash is on a machine with 4 GPUs.

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4  run_gpt.py \
                --model-name gpt2 \
                --data-files ./train_context.csv \
                --output_dir ./output \
                --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
                --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
                --data_path /ssd/datasets/imagenet/pytorch
```

User could enable zero optimization by set '--zero_optimization True', if the training fails with an out-of-memory (OOM) error.

```bash
python -m torch.distributed.launch --nproc_per_node=4  run_gpt.py \
                --model-name gpt2 \
                --zero_optimization True \
                --data-files ./train_context.csv \
                --output_dir ./output \
                --per_device_train_batch_size 4 \
                --gradient_accumulation_steps 4 \
                --data_path /ssd/datasets/imagenet/pytorch
```
